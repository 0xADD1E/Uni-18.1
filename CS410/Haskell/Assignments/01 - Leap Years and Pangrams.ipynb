So, for example, 1996, 2012, and 2020 are all leap years, but 2100, 2200, and 2300 are not leap years, because although they are all evenly divisible by 4, they are also evenly divisible by 100. However, 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years, because although they are divisible by 100, they are also divisible by 400.\n",
