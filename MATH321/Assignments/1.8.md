> Prove that $n^2 + 1 \ge 2^n$ when $n$ is a positive integer with $1 \le n \le 4$.

$n=1:\; 2\ge2$

$n=2:\; 5\ge4$

$n=3:\; 10\ge8$

$n=4:\; 17\ge16$

> Prove the triangle inequality, which states that if $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, then $|x| + |y| \ge |x+y|$ (where $|x|$ represents the absolute value of $x$, which equals $x$ if $x \ge 0$ and equals $âˆ’x$ if $x<0$).

### Case 1: $x\ge0;y<0$
$x + (-y)\ge |x+y|$

Recall that as $y$ is negative, adding $-y$ will always be larger
### Case 2: $x<0;y\ge0$
WLOG, same as Case 1
### Case 3: $x<0;y<0$
WLOG, same as Case 1
### Case 4: $x\ge0;y\ge0$
As $a=|a|$ for both $x$ and $y$, $|x| + |y| = |x+y|$, satisfying $|x| + |y| \ge |x+y|$

> Prove that there are 100 consecutive positive integers that are not perfect squares. Is your proof constructive or nonconstructive?

$2500 - 2601$ or, more intuitively, $50^2 - 51^2$

> Prove or disprove that there is a rational number $x$ and an irrational number $y$ such that $x^y$ is irrational.

$2^e \approx 6.58088599101 =$ an irrational number
