Per the definition of divisibility, when $a|b$, there is some integer ($c$) that $b = ac$. This holds true for any integer $c$

> Show that if a, b, and c are integers, where $a \ne 0$ and $c \ne 0$, such that $ac | bc$ , then $a | b$.

Consider integer $k$ such that $bc = ac\cdot k$

Both sides can be divided by $c$, leaving $b = ak$, which is the form of a divisibility statement
