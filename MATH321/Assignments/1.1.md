Having one variable true will result in $p\vee q\vee r$ being true, and one false will result in $\neg p\vee \neg q\vee \neg r$ being true (thus making the conjunction of the two true). However, all three being false will result in $p\vee q\vee r$ being false (making the conjunction false), and likewise with the latter half, and all three variables being true
