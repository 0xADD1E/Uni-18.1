Show that the square of an even number is an even number using a direct proof.

---

Take an even number $p$ such that $p = 2k$

$p^2 = (2k)^2$

$p^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$

As $p^2$ can be expressed in the form of $2(k)$, $p^2$ is even

Use a direct proof to show that every odd integer is the difference of two squares.

---

Take an odd integer $p$ such that $p = 2k+1$

$p = (k^2 - k^2) + 2k + 1$

$p = (k^2 + 2k + 1) - k^2$

$p = (k+1)^2 - k^2$
## 9
Use a proof by contradiction to prove that the sum of an irrational number and a rational number is irrational.

---

Assume that the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is rational

Take rational number $p = \frac{a}{b}$ and irrational number $q$

Their sum will be rational number $z = \frac{c}{d}$

Therefore, $z - p = \frac{e}{f}$

This would mean that $q = \frac{e}{f}$, however $q$ is irrational, meaning that it has no such representation

Therefore, the sum of an irrational number and a rational number is irrational


## 13
Prove that if $p$ is irrational, then $\frac{1}{p}$ is irrational.

---

Take irrational number $p$

Were its reciprocal $\frac{1}{p}$ to be rational, it would have a representation $\frac{a}{b}$

Therefore, the reciprocal of its reciprocal would be $\frac{b}{a}$, a rational number

Therefore, if $p$ is irrational, then $\frac{1}{p}$ is irrational
## 15
Use a proof by contraposition to show that if x + y ≥ 2, where x and y are real numbers, then x ≥ 1or y ≥ 1.
## 19
If $n$ is a positive integer greater than 1, then $n^2 > n$

---

Take positive integer $n$

$n^2 = n\cdot n$ 

The only way that $n\cdot n \le n$ is when n is less than 1

Therefore, if $n$ is a positive integer greater than 1, then $n^2 > n$
## 21
Let P (n) be the proposition “If a and b are positive real numbers, then (a + b) n ≥ a n + b n .” Prove that P( 1 ) is true. What kind of proof did you use?
## 27
Prove that if n is a positive integer, then n is odd if and only if 5 n + 6 is odd.
